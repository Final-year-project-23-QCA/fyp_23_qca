Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata(QCA) has been emerging as a new nanocomputing paradigm. QCA computing has many advantages like very high operating speed, extremely low energy dissipation, and very high device density.It is a transistor less technology that uses a square nanostructure called QCA cell comprising of 4 quantum dots. Two free electrons are introduced in a four quantum dot based QCA cell which can tunnel amongst the quantum dots and take seat in any one of them. The two free electrons settle into two stable states within QCA cell that are used to encode two binary states in digital circuits.
